This script installs my entire personal work environment automatically.

with the aim of not having to do all the configuration manually every time I create a virtual machine.
# Instalation

git clone https://github.com/mil4ne/Auto-Bspwm.git
```

```bash
cd Auto-Bspwm
```

```bash
g++ start.c++ -o start
```
```bash
chmod +x start
```

```bash
sudo ./start
```


In this environment we use:

- Kali Linux
- Bspwm
- Kitty Terminal
- Rofi
- Polybar 
- Bashtop
- Flameshot
- vscode
- Sxhkd

> this script was only tested on kali linux
