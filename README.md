This script installs my entire personal work environment automatically.

with the aim of not having to do all the configuration manually every time I create a virtual machine.

In this environment we use:

- Kali Linux
- Bspwm
- Kitty Terminal
- Rofi
- Polybar 
- Bashtop
- Flameshot
- vscode
- Sxhkd

> this script was only tested on kali linux
